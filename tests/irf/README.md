Test IRFs
=========

This folder contains the IRFs which can be used for tests and tutorials.

The corresponding data were downloaded from:

- https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3/irfs/full_enclosure/bkg/index.html#bkg-2d
- https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3/irfs/full_enclosure/bkg/index.html#bkg-3d

Then the `make.py` script was utilised to give the backgrounds the correct units, as specified on the 
above pages.
